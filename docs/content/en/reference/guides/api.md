The Authelia API documentation is heavily documented using the [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/)
specification. This documentation is automatically generated based on key information about your installation to best
support dynamically generating code.

You can access this documentation at the `/api/` path of your personal installation of Authelia. For example if you're
hosting the Authelia portal at `https://auth.example.com` if you visit `https://auth.example.com/api/` the documentation
will be served.
